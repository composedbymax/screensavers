# Screensaver App

This app showcases a collection of interactive and visually appealing GLSL shaders rendered as screensavers. The app allows users to switch between different screensavers, change colors dynamically, and toggle fullscreen mode.

## Features
- **Multiple Screensavers**: Includes various shaders such as "Neural Network" and "Particle Grid Dimension".
- **Dynamic Color Customization**: Use a color picker to change the color of the screensavers in real-time.
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Toggle between fullscreen and windowed mode with a simple button click.
- **Navigation**: Easily switch between screensavers using the left and right arrow keys.

## Shaders Included
1. **Neural Network**: Visualizes a simulated neural network with interactive connections and nodes.
2. **Particle Grid Dimension**: Generates a dynamic particle grid with rotating and fading particles.
3. **Many More**: Additional GLSL shaders are available for even more screensaver effects.
